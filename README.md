## Features

### Go to previous note

### Go to next note
Move to notes that backlink to the current note and have their `previous` property pointing to it.  
If multiple candidates exist, a suggestion modal will allow you to choose.

### Go to first note
Follow the `previous` property chain to reach the first note in the sequence.

### Go to last note
Use backlinks to find the last note in the sequence.  
If there are multiple candidates, a suggestion modal will appear for selection.
