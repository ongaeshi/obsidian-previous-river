# Previous River

A plugin for Obsidian that allows you to navigate between notes based on their `previous` property or backlinks.

## Features

### Go to Previous Note
Navigate to the note linked in the `previous` property of the current note's frontmatter.

### Go to Next Note
Navigate to notes that backlink to the current note and have their `previous` property pointing to the current note.  
If there are multiple candidates, a suggestion modal will appear for selection.

### Go to First Note
Traverse the `previous` property chain to navigate to the first note in the sequence.

### Go to Last Note
Traverse the backlinks to navigate to the last note in the sequence.  
If there are multiple candidates, a suggestion modal will appear for selection.
